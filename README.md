# Catch of the Day

### Created using https://www.reactforbeginners.com


## Summary

This is a simple, mostly single page app that might be used to by a seafood
restaurant to sell fish to people.

It's entirely client side, using React to render the vast majority of the HTML
that you see, and Firebase to store information.


## Getting Started

The first page you'll see is the storepicker page. All you have to do here is
enter the name of a store (can be anything) in the input and hit the Visit Store
button. There's even already been one randomly generated for you!

Once you've entered the store, login using GitHub, Facebook, or Twitter. You are
now the owner of this store, and only you can make changes to the fish in this
store.

Scroll to the bottom of the Inventory section, and hit the Load Sample Fishes
button to add some data into the app.


## Features

This was designed principally as a CRUD app to help teach the basics of React.
Users can add, remove, and update fish in the inventory, then add them to the
order. All of these actions are animated with transitions and will persist after
refreshing/leaving the page.
